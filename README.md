# Disease-Prediction-System-using-Machine-Learning
A Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning analyzes patient data such as symptoms, history, and lab results to predict disease likelihood. By leveraging algorithms like Random Forest, SVM, or deep learning, it improves diagnostic accuracy, enables early detection, and supports doctors in making timely healthcare decisions.

## Libraries and Tools  

- **Core**  
  - `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy` → numerical computation and data manipulation  

- **Visualization**  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly` → data exploration and visual insights  

- **Machine Learning**  
  - `scikit-learn` → preprocessing, baseline models (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression)  
  - `xgboost`, `lightgbm` → advanced boosting algorithms for improved accuracy  

- **NLP/Text (future extension)**  
  - `nltk`, `spacy` → preprocessing and analysis of unstructured medical text  

- **Model Persistence**  
  - `joblib`, `pickle5` → saving and loading trained models  

- **Utilities**  
  - `tqdm` (progress bars), `ipython`, `jupyterlab` (interactive development)
